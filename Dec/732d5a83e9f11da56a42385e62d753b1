IN recent years, despite recent setbacks from Ebola in West Africa and terrorism,&nbsp;Africa has still managed to under an image rehabilitation of sorts. But stereotypes are never far from the surface: Russia is Nigeria with snow. This year s fall in oil prices has put some countries in dire straits, with Russia seemingly in a particularly precarious position. Western sanctions over Russia&#8217;s support for separatists in eastern Ukraine have been hitting the country hard, and the oil troubles are another nail in the coffin.The country loses about&nbsp;$2bn in revenues for every dollar fall in the oil price, and the World Bank has warned that Russia&#8217;s economy would shrink by at least 0.7% in 2015 if oil prices do not recover.Back in 2002, Google s co-founder Sergey Brin&nbsp;said that Russia was nothing but Nigeria with snow , run by a bunch of criminal cowboys .When the quote again began doing rounds on Facebook last year, one commentator&nbsp;created a few charts to show that the two countries are at very different levels of development and have virtually nothing in common.That is, except corruption. In 2002, when Brin made the comment, Transparency International s Corruption Perception Index placed Russia at number 71 out of 102, while Nigeria was way at the bottom in second last place, 101.But fast-forward to 2014, and Brin was on to something there.&nbsp;This year s Corruption Perception Index shows the two countries have caught up with each other, placing Russia and Nigeria in the same position, tied at number 136 out of 174. Russia is Ouagadougou with rockets. This quote is attributed to Milton Bearden, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)&nbsp; officer when he has head of the Soviet-East Europe division at the agency in the early 1990s as the Soviet Union was collapsing.&nbsp;A book by Christopher Lynch, former CIA and FBI intelligence analyst&nbsp;describes Bearden s dismissal of the country at the time, referring to Russia as Ouagadougou with rockets , and saying it was no longer an ideological foe, economic rival or military threat, the only thing distinguishing Russia from Burkina Faso was its stockpile of nuclear weapons.Russia and Burkina Faso had very little in common twenty-five years ago, and even today, Burkina Faso s economy is 126 times smaller than Russia s when computed by purchasing power parity (PPP). But Ouagadougou is way friendlier to business than Moscow is. Although the World Bank s Doing Business survey places Russia as a whole far ahead of Burkina Faso, when broken down sub-nationally, it shows the&nbsp;city of Moscow is an extremely business-unfriendly place; Russia s high ranking is only boosted by a better business climate in other cities.It takes 13 days to&nbsp;start a business in Burkina Faso compared to 30 in Moscow, and 112 days to secure a construction permit in Burkina Faso compared to an astonishing 392 days in Moscow.And despite Russia having&nbsp;950 times more installed electricity capacity than Burkina Faso, it takes almost twice as long to get an electricity connection in Moscow (281 days compared to 158 days). Spain is not Uganda / Uganda is not Spain .In 2012, while negotiating a bank bailout for Spain s banks from the Eurozone Spain s prime minister&nbsp;texted this message to his finance minister urging him to hold&nbsp;out for a good deal: We re the number four power in Europe. Spain is not Uganda. The text was somehow leaked, causing an&nbsp;outburst of protest in the Twitterverse from Uganda under the hashtag #UgandaIsNotSpain, with Ugandans pointing out that while Spain was in the midst of an austerity bailout and facing a GDP slash of -2%, Uganda s was poised to grow 4%. Still,&nbsp;Uganda&#8217;s economy is one-hundredth that of Spain.Last month, the debate was reignited when President Yoweri Museveni&nbsp;said Uganda was a better tourist destination than Spain, berating the country s tourism promotion officials for merely promoting Uganda as having only some chimpanzees and so on .Uganda is a &#8220;good place on the globe where you go and have a nice life&#8221;, he said, pointing to a favourable climate unlike Spain which is too &#8220;hot and humid&#8221; in the summer.The comment raised some eyebrows, but when asked which of the two they would rather visit, readers of the Guardian&nbsp;voted overwhelmingly for Uganda, with 79% of the vote going to Uganda compared to 21% for Spain. South Africa is not Malawi .Last year, South African president Jacob Zuma was trying to defend the unpopular e-tolling system that would compel drivers to pay a tax for using some of the highways around Johannesburg.&#8220;We can&#8217;t think like Africans in Africa. It&#8217;s not some national road in Malawi,&#8221;&nbsp;said Zuma, which was immediately protested in Malawi. Malawi&nbsp;summoned South Africa&#8217;s top diplomat in Lilongwe to officially complain about the remark. South Africa s opposition party Democratic Alliance latched onto the gaffe, with&nbsp; party leader Mmusi Maimane&nbsp;quoted&nbsp;as saying What the president doesn&#8217;t realise is Africa is actually developing at a faster pace than he suggests. Many governments in African countries have adopted investor friendly policies that create jobs. They are not burdening citizens with double-taxation through an expensive e-tolling system. The African Development Bank&nbsp;estimates Malawi s real GDP growth to have been 5% in 2013 and is projected to accelerate to 6.1% and 6.2% in 2014 and 2015 respectively, driven by tobacco exports and continued growth in the key sectors of agriculture, manufacturing and services.But labour unrest and sluggish exports&nbsp;dampened South Africa s growth to 1.9% in 2013, projected to 2.4% in 2014 and 3% in 2015.Mr Zuma&#8217;s spokesman Mac Maharaj later apologised to those who felt offended by the comments.
