AFRICA&#8217;S Indian Ocean nations and&nbsp;other countries from around the Indian Ocean Rim will&nbsp;take part&nbsp;in mock tsunami scenarios on Wednesday. Dubbed&nbsp; Indian Ocean Wave 2014 or &#8220;IOwave14&#8221;, the exercise is meant&nbsp;to increase preparedness, evaluate each country s response capabilities and improve regional coordination.&nbsp;These exercises are important for Africa&#8217;s East and southern nations that have been severely&nbsp;affected in the past by tsunamis. Since&nbsp;1900three&nbsp;major tsunamis&#8212;which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;seismic sea wave usually caused by a major&nbsp;disruption such as an&nbsp;earthquake&#8212;have hit Africa, each affecting up to 11 countries,&nbsp;causing over 1,000 deaths and major economic destruction.&nbsp;The largest tsunami to affect Africa took place on December&nbsp;26, 2004 and was&nbsp;the largest ever recorded in the Indian Ocean, triggered by a 9.2 magnitude earthquake&#8212;the third&nbsp;largest in 100 years.&nbsp;Even though its epicentre&nbsp;was in Indonesia, the&nbsp;furthest recorded deaths were&nbsp;800&nbsp;kilometres away in Rooi Els,&nbsp;South Africa. &nbsp;Somalia was the most affected country&nbsp;on the African coast: the energy from the wave washed away approximately 400 people, mostly from the&nbsp;Puntland region. Other countries affected include the&nbsp;Maldives, Seychelles, Kenya, &nbsp;Madagascar, Tanzania, Comoros, Mauritius and Mozambique.The 2004 tsunami highlighted the need for Africa to&nbsp;to be better prepared.&nbsp;Today there&nbsp;are 26 national tsunami information centres set up in Indian Ocean countries, capable of receiving and distributing tsunami warnings. There are also three Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) sensors and other such equipment such as satellites that contribute data from seismographic stations.Since 2004&nbsp;there have been two other simulation exercises - &#8220;IOWAVE 09&#8221; and &#8220;IOWAVE&nbsp;11&#8221;.&nbsp;The simulations are designed to&nbsp;test procedures of the Indian Ocean tsunami warning and mitigation system and help identify&nbsp;operational strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;This week s exercise will&nbsp;comprise two scenarios: the first simulates an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1 south of Java, Indonesia; the second simulates an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 in the Makran Trench south of Iran and Pakistan.&#8220;The goal is to measure the capacity and response times of the various stakeholders involved to address such rare but potentially destructive events, &nbsp;stated a press release from UNESCO.The countries participating in the test are;&nbsp;Australia, Bangladesh, Comoros, La&nbsp;R union (France), India, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Yemen.
